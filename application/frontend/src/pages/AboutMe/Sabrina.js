                    I am a senior at SFSU studying Computer Science and looking forward to learning more with my peers. 
                    I enjoy playing games and chatting with friends online. My cat unfortunately passed a few weeks ago 
                    due to a health issue. I love our website concept and hope it's great for everyone too.
